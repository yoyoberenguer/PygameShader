Summary of the Library
This Python library provides fast and efficient image processing functions, 
focusing on blurring, Gaussian filtering, and edge detection. It is implemented 
in Cython for high performance, making it ideal for applications in computer vision,
 graphics, and image preprocessing.

Purpose
The library is designed to perform fast blurring and edge detection, which are essential for:

Noise reduction (smoothing images).
Edge detection (for object recognition and feature extraction).
Graphics effects (motion blur, bloom effects).
Preprocessing for computer vision tasks (image segmentation, filtering).
Main Features
1. Blurring Functions
These functions apply various types of blurring to smooth images:

blur(surface_, npass): Blurs an image surface, where npass controls intensity.
blur3d(rgb_array, npass): Blurs a 3D (RGB) image array.
blur1d(bgr_array, width, height, npass, format_32): Optimized 1D blurring for efficiency.
blur1d_cp(bgr_array, width, height, npass, format_32): Returns a new blurred array instead of modifying in-place.
blur4bloom_c(surface_, npass, tmp_array): Likely used for bloom effects, enhancing bright areas.
Several internal Cython-optimized versions (blur3d_c, blur1d_c, etc.) run without the Global
 Interpreter Lock (GIL) for multi-threading support.

2. Gaussian Filtering
gauss_filter24(surface_): Applies Gaussian blur to a 24-bit image.
gauss_filter32(surface_): Applies Gaussian blur to a 32-bit image.
ðŸ“Œ Why Gaussian Blur?
It helps smooth images before edge detection, reducing false edges caused by noise.

3. Edge Detection (Canny Algorithm)
The Canny algorithm is widely used in computer vision to detect object boundaries.

canny3d(rgb_array, threshold, low, high): Detects edges in an RGB image.
canny1d(bgr_array, width, height, format_32, threshold): Detects edges in a linear 1D image representation for efficiency.
There are also Cython-optimized versions (canny3d_c, canny1d_c) that improve performance using multi-threading.

Optimization Features
Cython-based (cdef, cpdef, nogil) â†’ Direct C-level performance.
In-place operations (blur1d, blur3d) â†’ Saves memory.
Multi-threading (nogil) â†’ Faster execution on multi-core processors.
Optimized memory handling ([::1] memory views) â†’ Reduces Python overhead.
Use Cases
Computer Vision â†’ Object recognition, feature extraction.
Graphics & Gaming â†’ Motion blur, bloom effects.
Image Processing Pipelines â†’ Preprocessing before machine learning models.
Medical Imaging â†’ Enhancing and detecting features in scans.
Conclusion
This library is highly optimized for fast blurring, Gaussian filtering, and edge detection,
making it a great choice for computer vision, graphics, and machine learning applications where speed is critical.
